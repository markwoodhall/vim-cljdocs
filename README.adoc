== Warning

This is a very, very rough proof of concept, it might break, or produce errors that interrupt your workflow. It is currently working well for me.

== Purpose

vim-cljdocs is a simple vim plugin that loads documentation from https://clojuredocs.org into a scratch buffer. As well as documentation
the plugin loads user contributed samples that can be eval'd from the buffer.

The plugin only makes available one command, `ClojureDocs`.

See the https://asciinema.org/a/261482[Demo]

== Requirements

- `curl`
- `jq`
